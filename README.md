# CS495_Kotlin_Text_Based
A simple, console-based project written in Kotlin for computer science seminar (just learning the language as I am coding).

Requirements and How I met Them:
1. I wrote 100% of this code myself.
2. All methods (two) run without error and give expected results for expected inputs.
3. All invalid-user-input gives proper feedback. No Unhandled Exceptions.
4. Code is consistently formatted and easily readable.
5. Sources are appropriately cited (I have none to site though).
6. All methods and classes are appropriately commented (maybe a bit too much :) ).
7. Program "goes above and beyond expectations of the minimum requirement." Given that the minimum is a hello world program, I think that this at least exceeds the minimum if not proceeding to far beyond expections.


I specifically ran the GuessANumber.kt (not the project) file located in src/main/kotlin via the IntelliJ integrated compiler running with JVM 1.8 and JRE 17.0.1. Any other configuration has not been tested and is not intended for use or guaranteed to work.
